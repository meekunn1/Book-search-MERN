# Book-search-MERN

## Description

This project was converting an prebuilt app that used RESTful API, into a one using [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/). By completing this project, I was able to practice working with [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and navigating through Apollo sandbox. It also allowed me to practice deploying an [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) server app using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform).
